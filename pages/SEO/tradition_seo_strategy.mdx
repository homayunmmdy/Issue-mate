# How AMP Works

- Keep third party JS the critical path
- Excute AMP is asynchronously
- Size all resources in advance
- Don't let anything block rendering
- All CSS is inline , and < 50KB
- Webfonts start downloading immediately
- resources prefetched early, but loaded lazily
- Preconnect for downloading above-the-filed content

## Special AMP considerations - Getting Started

```javascript
<script async src="https://cdn.amproject.org/v0.js"></script>
```

- AMP Runtime runs the show
- Validates your AMP in the JS console
  ```html
  <style amp-boilerplate>
    /*...*/
  </style>
  ```
- Must include excatly this style block

## Special AMP considerations - Images

- img tag is not good enough for a few reason
- srcset is important , and not supported everywhere
- must know dimensions without downloading the image
- dosen't let the AMP runtime decide when to load resources

```html
<amp-img src="welcome.jpg" alt="Welcom" height="400" width="800"> </amp-img>
```

## Special AMP considerations - Styles
```html
<style amp-custom>/*custome CSS*/</style>
```
- Inline styles must have amp-custome attribute
- !important is not allowed
- transition : only GPU-accelerated properties allowed(opacity, transform)
