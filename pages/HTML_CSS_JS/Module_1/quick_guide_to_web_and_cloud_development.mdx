# 🌐 Quick Guide to Web & Cloud Development

Here's a snapshot of how websites work!

1. Open a browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. Enter a URL (e.g., www.IBM.com).
3. Browser contacts a server to fetch website content:
   - **HTML**: structure 📄
   - **CSS**: style 🎨
   - **JavaScript**: interactivity ⚙️

## 🔍 Website Content Types
1. **Static**: Same every time it loads.
2. **Dynamic**: Pulls real-time data from other sources (like databases).

## ☁️ Cloud Applications
Cloud apps work with cloud-based data storage and processing, making them scalable and resilient!

### 🖥️ Main Cloud Areas
1. **Frontend**: Client-side (HTML, CSS, JS).
2. **Backend**: Server-side, handles data and security.
3. **Full Stack**: Skills in both frontend & backend.
