# 🎨 Learning Front-End Development

When you browse an online shopping site—searching, filtering, or comparing items—you’re interacting with the **front-end** of a website. Here’s how it’s created! 

## 🔧 Core Building Blocks
- **HTML**: Structure 📄
- **CSS**: Style 🎨
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity ⚙️

### ✨ Enhanced Tools
- **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)**: 
  - An extension of CSS, supporting variables, nested rules, and imports for faster, organized styling.

- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Ensures the website adapts to any device screen size 📱💻.

### 🔥 Popular Frameworks
- **Angular**: Open-source, by Google.
- **React.js**: Created by Facebook.
- **Vue.js**: Community-maintained, focused on the view layer.

Front-end developers use these tools to build engaging, responsive websites.
