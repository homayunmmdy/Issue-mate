## Images

for the screen readers if you do not put the alt attirubte it would be read the src of the image sometime is good when provide nice name for image but if you let user
upload image it will give theme very bad experiences beacause it is generate the id of from database user id and stuff like that it will be few numbers some random characters
that makes not senes for the users.
for this situation you do not what to put you had 2 options first is write in alt user image second put empty alt by doing this the sreen reader will be skip it.

## Video and Sounds

for this type of files we provide subtitle which good for screen reader and also seo

## Accessible HTML

we have some dude that mostly used the div in all the palcce it's bad for seo and Accessible
so here are tags that don effect like

- Footer
- Header
- aside
  other provide lot's of build in functinaliy such as :
- button
- input
- textarea

also try to use the right h tag as much as you need for example do not use it just for size use when ever need and modified based on size

## Form Labels

easy but with the big impact here is the most comon Form

```html
<form>
  <p>First Name</p>
  <input type="text" />
  <p>Last Name</p>
  <input type="text" />
  <p>Password</p>
  <input type="password" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

this is good for nomarl users but try to use label inside of those p that that dose other with problem can understand this

```html
<form>
  <label for="first">First Name</label>
  <input id="first" type="text" />
  <label for="last">Last Name</label>
  <input id="last" type="text" />
  <label for="password">Password</label>
  <input id="password" type="password" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

label is very good it's only worked on

- button
- input
- keygen
- meter
- output
- Progressive
- select
- textarea

if you element is out of this you can use arita-label like this

```html
<div aria-label="Interactive div">Hello</div>
```

## button

look at this simple button when click it is show the hello alert

```html
<button onClick="alert('Hello')">Click ME</button>
```

but in some situation we can use button we use div like this

```html
<div onClick="alert('Hello')">Click ME</div>
```

but the proble here where screen reader click it has no idea what is the purpose of it and what is dose screen reader can not listen and understand what to
we have nice called role button then screen reader will see it and it's read it as button

```html
<div role="button" onClick="alert('Hello')">Click ME</div>
```

also it has problem we can focus on it with keyboard for fix we need to add 
tabindex 0 to allow HTML element to recive focus zero because work in an accessible way

```html
<div tabindex="0" role="button" onClick="alert('Hello')">Click ME</div>
```

also you need to add onkeyup for the users that use only keyboards

```html
<div tabindex="0" role="button" onClick="alert('Hello')" onkeyup="alert('Hello')">Click ME</div>
```

at the end at the aria-label to help screen reader understand the button

```html
<div aria-label="Alert the word Hello" tabindex="0" role="button" onClick="alert('Hello')" onkeyup="alert('Hello')">Click ME</div>
```
