# The most important rule of money SPEED

## Everything you do done it very fast

Speed is crucial in business, and it's often misunderstood. It doesn't mean sacrificing quality for haste; it means completing tasks efficiently. Just like in martial arts, where increasing speed doesn't mean compromising technique.

In today's world, especially in creative fields, people struggle to grasp the importance of speed. Creatives have unique strengths, but speed isn't typically one of them. However, speed is essential in business. Consider an airplane; even if its engines fail, it can continue to fly due to forward momentum. Similarly, a business must keep moving forward, always producing and improving.

Don't confuse speed with poor quality. You can achieve both speed and quality. Unrealistic timeframes are common, but things can be done quickly. For instance, I could learn web design and build a website in two weeks, and I know nothing about it. So, why should a web design expert take that long? Being slow can be deadly for a company, both in terms of missing out on immediate profits and losing long-term opportunities.
