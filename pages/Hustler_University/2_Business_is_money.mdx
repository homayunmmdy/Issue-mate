# A business is only money in your bank. That is all.

Your business is not your logo, your accountant, your lawyer, your office space, copyright, etc. All of these things cost money and do not make money.

the only thing you must is focus is how can  I make more money. you don't need anything untill people start paying you 
money the first question where is the money in the business how you are gonna get paid how people paid you and how 
convince people to do that work on how convince people to pay you
