- **📅 Started:** August 3, 2025  
- **🎉 Completed:** August 8, 2025  

## **📌 About the Course**  
A **structured, hands-on** course teaching full-stack development with:  
- **⚡ Next.js 13+** (App Router)  
- **🛠 TypeScript**  
- **🗃 Prisma** (Database ORM)  
- **🎨 Tailwind CSS** (Styling)  
- **🧩 Radix UI** (Accessible components)  
- **🔒 NextAuth.js** (Authentication)  

**🔥 Key Topics Covered:**  
✅ Building a **full-stack issue tracker** from scratch  
✅ **RESTful API design** with Next.js Route Handlers  
✅ **Modern UI development** using Radix + Tailwind  
✅ **Database integration** with Prisma (SQL)  
✅ **Authentication & authorization** workflows  
✅ **Performance optimization** and deployment  

Taught by **👨‍💻 Mosh Hamedani**, the course focuses on **practical, scalable project structure** and industry best practices.  

## **🎯 Why I Took This Course**  
I’ve built several Next.js projects but wanted to:  
🔹 **🔧 Sharpen my architecture skills** (folder structure, modular design)  
🔹 **📐 Master Mosh’s coding methodology** for maintainable apps  
🔹 **🧠 Deepen my understanding** of full-stack patterns in Next.js  
🔹 **⌨️ Apply TypeScript rigorously** across frontend and backend  

The course helped me **systematize my workflow** and adopt proven techniques for:  
- **🧹 Clean state management**  
- **⚠️ Error handling**  
- **⚡ Performance tuning**  
- **🚀 Deployment pipelines**  

## **💡 Course Highlights**  

### **📖 What I Learned**  
- **🔀 Next.js App Router** – Dynamic routes, loading states, and API routes  
- **🗂 Prisma** – Model relationships, migrations, and queries  
- **🔐 Auth** – Role-based access control with NextAuth.js  
- **🖌 UI/UX** – Accessible components (Radix) + responsive design (Tailwind)  
- **☁️ Deployment** – Vercel configuration and CI/CD optimizations  

### **📂 Project Structure**  
The `./issue-tracker` directory reflects my implementation of the course project, with:  
- **🔄 Custom hooks** for reusability  
- **📜 Type-safe API endpoints**  
- **🧩 Modular component design**  

## **🚀 How I Used This Knowledge**  
Beyond the course, I applied these principles to:  
- **♻️ Refactor legacy Next.js projects**  
- **👥 Improve team collaboration** through consistent patterns  
- **⚡ Optimize database queries** in production apps  

## **📜 Note on Course Access**  
Due to international sanctions in Iran, I was unable to access the official Frontend Masters platform directly. I obtained the course through a third-party distributor and completed it in full. Although I don’t hold an official certificate, I carefully followed the course and documented my learnings here.
